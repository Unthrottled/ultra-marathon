Back when I unknowingly started my _ultramarathon_, I did not have any clear set goals or things that I wanted to accomplish.
If I did, then it was not important enough of an event for me to remember.

However, as time passed, think I realized that I could dedicate my effort accomplishing something specific.
What I was searching for was a way to fill a specific skill weakness or desire.

A ton of my time has been invested into completing tasks that worked me towards my main goals.
It makes me pretty happy that over the last 4 years, I've only got 3 major accomplishments.
I never explicitly planned out what I wanted to work on, goals happen to appear as time moved on.
Serendipity may come to mind, or even happy accidents.
In reality, I feel like I just stumble on something and decide to roll with it.


This effort of self-reflection showed that I stayed on a simple but difficult path.
I do not want many things is life, but I _do_ want the things that I own to have great meaning.
