My accomplishments lack cohesion, due to the fact that my _ultramarathon_ was started by accident. There was no defined
starting date or conscious decision to start. Just an eventual realization that I have started a long-term habit. Saying
that I had an outline for how my time should have been spent at the start would be a blatant lie.

As time passed, I eventually directed my focus to accomplishing specific and difficult to obtain goals. In the
beginning, this ultramarathon was target to a weakness in skill, then in evolved into satisfying my creative desires.

Mostly through reflection, I have derived goals from my current accomplishments and turned them into a cohesive story.
The goals I work towards and cherish today, came about mostly due to dumb luck and not because of strategic planning.

A massive amount of time has been invested into completing tasks bringing me closer to completion of my main goals. It
makes me pretty happy that over the last 4 years, I only have 3 major accomplishments. I never explicitly planned out
what needed to be worked. The opportunity just presented itself, and I just rolled with it.

I am grateful my life's journey stayed simple while remaning difficult. I do not want many things in this life. What I _
do_ want, is for the things I possess to have great meaning.
