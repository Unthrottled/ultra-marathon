Back when I unknowingly started my _ultramarathon_, where not any clear set goals or accomplishments. Saying that there
was an outline for how my time should have been spent, at the start, would be a lie.

However, as time passed, there was a realization that I could dedicate effort to accomplishing a specific goal. Meaning
that as time has gone on, I _do_ posses a high level outline of how life should work out.

In the beginning, there was a search for a way to fill a specific skill weakness or desire. Mostly through reflection, I
have turned my current accomplishments into a cohesive story. They have mostly been put together after the fact, from
all the artifacts generated over the process. Not because there were life goals guiding it all upfront.

A massive amount of time has been invested into completing tasks. Tasks that bring the completion of my main goals
closer. It makes me pretty happy that over the last 4 years, there are only 3 major accomplishments. I never explicitly
planned out what I wanted to work on, these goals happen to appear as time moved on. Serendipity may come to mind, or
even happy accidents. In reality, I just stumbled across an opportunity and decide to roll with it.

This effort of self-reflection reveals that I stayed on a simple but difficult path. I do not want many things
is life, but I _do_ want the things that I have to have great meaning.
