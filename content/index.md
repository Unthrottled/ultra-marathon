# Preface

Although I did not know it at the time, April 2017 marked the start of a big chapter in my life.
These past 4 years of diligent work has been fueled by a mix of discipline and stubbornness.
The chapters of this book will tell the some of the stories behind a ridiculous open-source software contribution streak.

Since starting as a _professional_ software developer back in 2015, I have never worked a job that contributes to open source.
What you see above, is small window into the world that exists outside the 8 hours spent developing software to put food on my plate.
This contribution streak only paints a vague and unclear picture of how my time was spent.

In fact, here is a list of some true statements and rhetorical questions I think you can derive _only_ from observing my contribution graph:

- "He is dedicated to working on something."
- "The discipline is strong in this one."
- "Doesn't he know how to give up?"
- "He probably has nothing better to do."

A picture is worth a thousand words, right? Leaving my entire story to be told only by green squares on some website, which only has meaning to my peers, is unacceptable.
Just moving on without saying anything, feels wrong.

What I am going to do instead, is catalog all the important lessons learned from shoving my face into the grindstone over the past 7 years.
In hopes of giving myself the ability to _let go_ of past habits and start a new chapter of my life. All in the name of finding greater meaning and purpose.

Yes, I am aware that it is the same thing as _giving up_.
However, that message is wrapped in a pretty bow and easier to cope with.

I want to start the next chapter in my life, but first my friend, let me tell you places I have been to so far.

# What to expect

As you might have already guessed, most of these posts are going to be really personal.
Nothing crazy intimate, but you are going to get a good idea of who I am.
While I do feel a bit uneasy about sharing these posts, I also have to think about the other side of the coin.
Reading or listening to stories about someone's life is something I find interesting. Therefore, it should be acceptable for others to take a glimpse into mine.

Hopefully you will spend less time figuring out some lessons I learned the hard way. That you _do not_ need to spend a ridiculous amount of time outside of work, to get better at doing _work_.

I still think that you should at least try to find your ultimate version, the peak of your performance. Just make sure you avoid getting yourself stuck in into a time sink you fell into a long time ago.

Also keep in mind, that most of these words are directed towards me.
This is an effort in helping me let go of something that is starting to no longer deliver expected results.

I would like to think this is for others who are like me, however I know that wishful thinking. Those who are _really_ like who I am now, are not going to read this, because they are not looking for it. They are pre-occupied by creating their own treasures, and are not actively searching this type of content.

Who knows, you might also get an interesting story out of this!

# How to Consume

I am essentially writing a memoir about the past 7 years of my life.
At the time of writing this, I am not currently into sitting down and reading large blocks of text.
Therefore, I do not expect you to do the same.

I decided to break each of these posts down in such that they can be read independently of each other.
It is the combination of all these independent stories that paints the bigger picture of my journey.

Feel free to pick and choose what seems to be the most interesting.
I tried to make the titles, in the left-hand navigation bar, seem to lead to something interesting and not misleading.
