There are many long-running tasks that I have performed over my the entirety of my life, many of which during my
ultramarathon. It could be from: [learning how to communicate well](../accomplishments/a_thecommunicator),
to [re-learning mathematics](../accomplishments/b_machinelearning), or even my journey as an athlete.

One task stands above them all as the most difficult to perform. It comes in the shape of breaking an existing habit. As
you might have already been able to tell, I have _very_ strong routines, so my habits are strongly set.

If you had asked me what my hardest challenge was, 7 years ago, I might have answered, giving up https://reddit.com.
Reddit was engraved into my daily life, such that I would always be checking it if I had downtime. I needed constant
stimulation and Reddit solved that for me. However, I did not like the headspace that it put me in, so I decided to quit
cold turkey. I soon realized that I did not really use the internet for much other than using Reddit. So I had a bit of
an empty pit that Reddit left behind. Breaking muscle memory of constantly checking to see if people said interesting
things, is really tough, but not as tough as the thing that I struggled the most to accomplish.

**Getting enough sleep** is the current hardest challenge I have had to overcome. The years of me trying to become the
best version of myself required me to pick up a new mindset, outlook on life, and habits. This turned me into a tightly
wound machine that was capable of accomplishing many things. Unfortunately, this can also lead to problems of another
sort, not being able to wind down.

Working out and busting my butt, honestly is the easiest part of the day. To this day, I still do not know where my
endless internal drive is sourced. I do know that have no trouble running myself into the ground, getting back up and
doing it again. I would fill my days to the brim with character building activities. Then would wonder why I am having
such a hard time falling to sleep.

Well, I eventually figured out what my problem was, and it only took me up until the time of writing this to figure it
out.

# How it started

In the very beginning of my athletic journey, I wanted to be good at road cycling. Well, the biggest problem about road
cycling, is that you have to share the road with fast moving, instant death machines. To prolong my life, the safest
workaround that I could think of was to perform the activity in the early hours of the morning. The idea was, it is hard
to get hit by a car if everybody is still sleeping. This worked out well, for the most part, traffic was almost
non-existent, however it was also dark. This meant that I had to be tricked out in lighting gear to see and to be seen.
Another big problem is when it started to get colder. I learned early on, that I was not going to let the weather stop
me from getting my ride in. As you might have guessed, the sun keep things warm, and when It's not up it gets _really_
cold. It gets to the level of cold where you have to wrap your feet, that already have two socks, in aluminium foil to
avoid loosing heat.

Anyways, the point that I am trying to get at, is that I had to wake up early for this to happen. I would get up at 4:30
and be out the door by 5:00 to hit the roads. I would continue to keep this habit well beyond when I switch athletic
goals. My normal habit now is, wake up at 4:00, start working on my free-time project, stop at 6:00. Get myself around
and be done working out around 7:30. After that, it would be off to work from 8:00 to 16:00. After completing work for
the day, I would eat, meditate, and walk before 17:00. From 17:00 to 19:00 I would then continue my other free-time
project. Once 19:00 rolls around, I needed to prep my meals for the next day, shower, eat, and try to get to sleep.

That was my routine for the longest time, and I was wondering why I was having such a hard time getting to sleep. I
would look at my schedule, and think that I have an entire hour to wind down, so why am I having issues?

It evolved to the point, where I was also having trouble sleeping on the weekends as well. The entire time I knew that I
had a problem, but I did not do anything about it. I knew that sleep was important, however I was neglecting it, getting
6-7 hours worth of sleep a night.

# Lying to myself

You and I both know this fact very well, "Sleep is important." We both might know this fact, but I did not _understand_
the significance of it. Voluntary comatose is crucial for peak performance. Even after reading these books on human
performance:

I knew the significance of what having a good night of sleep gives you, however I still did not understand that it _did_
apply to me as well. I had a bunch of habits that enabled sleep deprivation, and was doing nothing about it.

The lie that I told myself was, "I am strong-willed, therefore I have habits. Because my habits are hurting me, I can
change my habits." It was not until I reached a really tough point in my life, that the previous statement was **the
biggest lie**, I ever told myself.

Over the years of my self-improvement journey, have had one goal I held sacred, "Though shalt not lie to thyself."
Lying is only good for attempting to impress others, and it _does not_ help get one stronger. Just because you might be
impressed, does not change the fact that I did not or could not do it.

The one of the most prevalent places where this come into play is: athleticism. You can lie to yourself about being
capable, but that does not make you stronger. Sure, I could through around a heavy weight and pretend like I am strong,
but that just makes me prone to injury and empty on the inside. What is the point of doing something, just to impress
other people? I am the one that has to live with myself at the end of the day. I am the one that has to give my life
meaning, I have to fight my battles. Just because other people think that I am cool, does not solve my problems. Sure it
might help, but in the end, I am the one that has to put up with my hardships. Yes, others can support me, but I am the
one that has to pull myself out of the hole.

Overtime, I have learned that it is the actions that we take when we feel the worst, that defines what we are capable of
accomplishing. I cannot be the best version of myself by lying, because lies do not help when you feel like crap and
want to give up. What I am trying to get as is, I do not want to lie to myself.
