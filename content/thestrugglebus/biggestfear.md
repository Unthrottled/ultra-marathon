Being scared has its place in life, and I think it is a normal emotion to have. If it was not normal, then what was the
point of adding this to our portfolio of feelings? I believe there are many categories that the emotion fear can fit
into. There is the flavor of fear that protects you from a painful death. Another one is makes it difficult to perform
various social activities, such as talking to one or many people. There are some ones that are not rational as well.
However, the brand of fear that I will be talking about is the fear of the unknown.

There are many things that I still do not understand about myself. For the most part, I can find the various motives for
most of my actions. Most of these just feel like rationalizations to things that are inherently have no meaning, but it
makes me feel good, so how bad can it be?

It is the uncertainty of not knowing when an inevitable action is going to occur that bothers me the most. This may be
fear or anxiety, whatever this takes the form of, it is not pleasant.

# Adopting Essentialism.

The practice of Essentialism is to let go of anything that is not really important, so that you are left with the time
and space to appreciate what you value the most. You could argue that this is just Minimalism, but with a different
attitude. While you would not be wrong, I feel like the point of Minimalism can be misused.

It is not necessarily just the act of getting rid of things and avoiding the ownership of many possessions. No, the
concept is more making space for the things that matter. When everything is important, then nothing is important. My
attention can only be given to a small subset of things. Therefore, I want to have the capacity to dedicate a large
portion of my focus to a small set things that bring me great meaning. I feel like that meaning is better conveyed by
re-skinning Minimalism as Essentialism.

Owning stuff or buying the next new flashy item stopped appealing to me after some period in my life. I was not able to
find meaning is searching for the next gadget to buy or video game to play. Having _things_ did not necessarily satisfy
my need for purpose.

Another thing that I also wanted to keep more to myself, was my headspace. Having a mind that you can be present with
and not constantly needing to be stimulated, is a feeling everybody should know. However, we live in a world where
everything is buying for your attention. One of the first things that went was paying attention to things that are out
of my control. Why do I need to know about the news or what people are doing around me, if there is not anything I can
do about it? The only thing that I can control, in that respect, is my attention to it. Sure this may be a close-minded
approach, but I have found the things that a _really_ important find another way to reveal themselves.

In the end, I have basically reduced how I treat my smartphone. It has become a tool that helps me, and not a source of
meaning.
