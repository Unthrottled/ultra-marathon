This is the exciting part of the whole adventure, nothing is written in stone at the moment. Everything is subject to
change, and I get to choose where go. Sure, I may not have complete control over what happens around me. However, I have
complete and absolute control as to how I handle the cards I am dealt.

Though I may not know explicitly how my next coming years are going to fold out, I do know what I would like to be
missing. The absence of feeling like I need to prove something every day, in the form of committing and pushing code to
source code repositories, is one of them. That is not to say that is something I never want to do again, I just do not
want it to be seated with the level of importance it has right now.

The idea that I can grow as a person, without needing to be in-front of a computer, or documenting it so others know I
am self-improve improving, is not far fetched. Convincing myself that is the case is another feat in of itself. I have a
ton of momentum and inertia built up, at the moment. There are projects that I _do_ want to be spending my time on,
however, they are not the only things that I need to work on.

I would like to spend my focused energy on other topics, that are not career building, as well. Tre is more to life than
just become a really valuable employee. The vast pool of experiences, I have yet to tap, is invigorating.

# Foreign Experiences

I have been leading a fairly white-bread life so far. Do not get me wrong, being plain is great and not experiencing
adversity has had its advantages. However, I feel like I am missing out on various character building exercises. Being a
white, late-twenties, middle-class, male living in America, basically means that I am invisible. Nothing really special
about me at first glance. I do not stand out, sometimes it is nice being able to blend in and pretend that nobody can
see me.

However, I have gotten comfortable with that, and would like to know what it is like to be _different_, an outsider. I
feel like there are many things that I can discover about myself, if I become immersed into a place where I am _not_ the
standard.

That means that I get to travel! The real question was, where to?

Growing up just knowing one language has made me feel like I am missing out on something. All I have ever known, is
English, and becoming fluent in another language was a foreign concept. Sure, I have dabbled in learning Spanish in
high-school, but I wanted to choose something that was difficult to learn and very different from English.

The first thing I did was to pass over learning Japanese. I feel like one of the weird anime fans, where I enjoy
consuming Japanese pop culture, but have a small desire to actually visit the country.

The other acceptance criteria was that it had to be at least applicable to my future career. So skipping over learning
Arabic was a sound choice. Which narrowed down the list to: Russian, Hindi, or Chinese.

The large majority of the users of my software products, which is related to software development, comes from 3
countries: China, The United States, and Russia. The argument for learning Russian was strong, there are a ton of slavic
hackers and the language appears to be in different league of its own. Learning Hindi was also very appealing. It was
also very foreign as compared to English. Another big plus, and this might because of the availability bias, but going
to school and starting my professional career, I have been around a bunch of Indian folk. In fact, at the time that I
was deciding, both of my co-workers where from India.

Ihe end, I decided that learning Mandarin was the best choice. Not only is the language visually nothing like English,
it is also spoken by a large mass of people. Granted, that mass is not anywhere near the center of America, but still.
We live in an age where we are becoming more connected, and I felt like China has the most promise. There is a wealth of
potential sources of information, help, and experiences, that exist across the ocean.

When I started, I knew that I would be in it for the long haul. Everything I had read from others accounts, is that I
would not expect to see results for over 2 years. 虽然今年我开始学习中文很但是我还是新手。Let me tell you right now, for me, Chinese is
quite difficult. I have to memorise not only the characters, but also the stroke order, tones of the character, any tone
changing rules when paired with other characters, and sprinkle in a bit of grammar. Thankfully, Chinese grammar is not
very difficult.

So with that decided, I would like to at least have the chance to visit China before I decide where I want to go next in
life. Given that 2021 is still a world lingering in a pandemic, I still have plenty of time to keep studying before I
get a chance to visit.

# Meeting New People

Another area of my life that I have neglected, is the social aspect. While I have spent most of my time building myself
up alone, that does not mean that I am completely introverted. I have these things called social skills, I can hold a
conversation on interesting topics, and am generally articulate with my thoughts. While I do not explicitly seek out
social integration, it is not I am not worn down by it.

Right now my current goal in life is to be the best version I can possibly be, and other people cannot do that for me.
The can give me the opportunity to allow myself to go to the next level, but I am the one who has to do that work. I
have not focused on other people at the moment, because they could not give me what I wanted. The validation that I was
seeking, was something I thought only I could give myself.
