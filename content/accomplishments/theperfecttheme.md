I am looking forward to the day, when somebody asks me how I got my current technical skill set. The response is not
going to be something like, "Hard work and dedication", "Solving many disparate problems", or even "Reading a bunch of
other people's code".

No, I want to look them dead in the eyes and honestly answer:

![One of life's greatest treasures: Anime Girls](../images/one_of_lifes_greatest_treasures.jpg)

Anything else would just be covering up this fact. I attribute most of my technical prowess, because of _anime girls_.

For starters, I am not the kind of person that always has the "next hot idea". I have difficulty creating from a blank
slate. I am more of a give me a problem, I will find a way to bridge the gap. Needless to say, when I came up with the
idea, that I could write code in an editor that is themed to an anime girl. I held onto it with an iron grip.

Feel free to take a peek at https://doki-theme.unthrottled.io/ if you need some context.
