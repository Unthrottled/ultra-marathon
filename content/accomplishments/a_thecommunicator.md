Very early into my professional software development career and just before my ultramarathon, I realized there was that
I had a gap in a very specific skill. That skill was being able to express my thoughts in a coherent matter to others.
Not being able to convey that something is not right about a design, requirement, or code. This fact was almost
immediately apparent to me.

This was something that I had not learned about in school, nor did I expect this. I would be able to look at something,
have a feeling that it is not correct, but was not able to pin-point the issue. Which would then in turn make it almost
impossible to convey this to another person. How could I express something to somebody else, if I myself do not full
understand the issue.

Looking back at this initial problem, I think it might have been an artifact of me being at the very beginning of my
programming journey. Everything was shiny and new, and I wanted to do everything right!

# Accidentally Breaking The Communication Barrier

At the time, I know that I wanted to make myself better at my career, however I had no idea what to do. What I was
missing was the _next big idea_ to work on. Some project that I could spend my time totally focused on that would build
my skills.

In the end, I did come up with an idea. Which was, "I am going to consume as much information as I possibly can."
When the topics are interesting, learning is just a positive side effect. I vividly remember when I started to listen
to [Software Engineering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/), the feeling of, _I do not know anything, and the amount of
information out there to consume is humongous_.

I took that as a hint, and should double down on my ability to consume information. I made it a point to become better
at reading and listening to what other people have to say. Having only a limited amount of free time between commitments
such as: work, sleep, exercise, and eating. Means that I had to learn how to densely pack in education, and still be
able to retain it. Thankfully, we live in a world with technology, and people who like to speak words about interesting
stuff.

This means that most of my knowledge has been consumed in the form of audio, ranging from videos lectures, audiobooks,
and podcasts. The shear weight of knowing that I would probably be spending years to get to where I want to be, was
heavy. So the revelation of _consume faster_ was my goal. Consuming information was all I had at the time, so why not be
really good at that? Since most of the information I wanted was on the audio medium, most player have a speed-up
function.

Something that I picked up during my video game phase, was how to acclimate to higher sensitivity. Most video games
allow you to control the mouse or joystick sensitivity. If you have a high sensitivity, you have the ability to react
quicker. In my case, it was point and shoot. Nothing like snapping 180 degrees and destroying the person behind you.
Well, in order for me to get to the point where my movements where quick because I had high sensitivity, I had to
incrementally work up. I would start a day, and I would bump up the mouse sensitivity to a step where, it was higher
than I was used to and a bit uncomfortable. I would spend matches getting used to not overdoing my movements. Once I
felt like I was starting to get the hang of it, I would then bump up the sensitivity and repeat the process. I would
keep going until I either maxed out the sensitivity scale, or did not see any improvement overtime.

Turns out that same process works for speeding up audio. Start by bumping up the playback speed of the audio. This new
speed requires more focus on what is being said and comprehending the topic at hand. Which limits the amount of things
you can do at a time. I would repeat the process of, once things got comfortable, bump it up a little. This process
repeated until I found where if it was set any faster, then listening is the only thing I could do. The playback speed
of x2.35 is where my limit is. Anything faster and I have to sit down and just listen to comprehend the subject at hand.
Which means I cannot do other things require less focus such as: going on really long walks, washing my car, and
driving. Another thing that I have noticed, playing back audio faster requires the volume to be increased. I have also
noticed that my focus on any noise increases the louder the sound becomes. As it becomes the only thing I can hear, it
also becomes the only thing I can focus on.

There was a brief period of time when I would consume analog books. The biggest problem with books, is the sitting down
in one place and not doing anything. Programming has me stationary in front of a computer for the most of my time.
Sitting down in one place and consuming is book is difficult to do, because I need to move. I would take advantage of
times when I should be sitting down and not expected to be doing anything. Such as, when laundry is being done. However,
audiobooks are superior because I can do low impact things while consuming knowledge.

Some time in the past, I felt bad about all of my knowledge being unoriginal and borrowed from others. It was like all
of my thought where unoriginal, and I should not be sharing them. As life continued, I realized that it is the
combination of everything that I consume gives me a unique perspective of the world. Borrowing the thoughts of others
hand-picked by the luck of the draw, forms a picture of the world that only I have. Until we reach singularity, and
anyone can know anything at any time, I still have something to contribute.

If you are curious, and want to take a slice of the same thoughts I have taken from others, feel free to browse my book
collection.

Now I did not originally forget the topic of the section, _accidentally breaking the communication barrier_. The stage
has been set though, because here is how it happened. The piece of the puzzle that I did not know I was missing was,
other people's perspectives. As I consumed more and more of others' opinions and teachings of the world, the more my own
thoughts became clear. Enabling me to start to speak comprehensibly about a topic because, somebody els had the same
feelings but was able to communicate it better. This in turn created a positive feedback loop. The more I consumed, the
better I became at communicating with others.

# Exercises in Communication

However, as time passed, I began to feel something was missing from what I was doing. I was hoarding knowledge others so
kindly spent the time giving out, and was not giving that back to anybody else. Which eventually lead me to the very
beginning of my GitHub contribution streak, or the _ultramarathon_ as I call it.

### Starting a blog

This is the very thing that got me started with getting hooked on doing something every day. Previously, I had tried to
get myself into a habit of betting my skills as a software developer, but those faded out. Mostly because, I had no
ideas on interesting problems to solve.

It took copious amounts of knowledge consumption for me to discover that I could write about my own technical
experiences. Problems that I have had to solve, and the Google machine could not help me with it.
Thus, https://blog.unthrottled.io was born, and I started something that would consume a large portion of my attention
and require discipline. All without having any exit plan thought out or knowing when I should be done with this chapter
of my self-improvement journey.

Writing a blog was a positive experience. It increased my ability to write more coherent emails, and convey my feelings
in the written medium, better. However, I stopped contributing to it after I figured out that building things with new
technology was cooler. A couple of months after starting, I had stopped writing blog posts, and started writing new
applications. Fairly confident this was when I found [Software Engineering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/), because
that podcast showed me a new world of neat things. I wanted hands-on experience with the cutting edge tools that the
cool kids where using. I had to do this on my free time as well, because at the time I was working for the government,
and we were still writing SOAP services.

This new trend of self-improvement would continue into early 2018, and shortly change when I started my next career.
Around this time, I was searching for new things to learn, because the technical stack I was working with was different.
New technology, new challenges, and more things to learn. It was also around this time I
discovered [Anime Girls](c_theperfecttheme) and that I [should get better at math](b_machinelearning). Needless, to say
my direct dedication to getting better at communicating took a backseat. It was still important and still gets
attention, but it was not the main goal to accomplish.

Although that was the end of this journey, I still was able and willing to share things that I have learned overtime and
before-hand. Take for instance, I spent a fair amount of time diving
into [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) and adopted the
non-blocking [Spring webflux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html)
before starting my new chapter. I had a fair amount of understanding on how these new and strange programming paradigms
worked. Also, explaining the new concepts these paradigms introduce, where difficult using only words. I remembered that
I can build things with computers to explain stuff, so https://learn-functional.unthrottled.io/ was born!
The primary reason I wanted it, was to explain the
concepts [using animations](https://learn-functional.unthrottled.io/reactive/concepts/reactor/visualisations/intermediate/zipWith)
. It also helped solidify my understanding of the topics as well, because I used the same paradigms to implement the
animations!
