Very early into my professional software development career and just before my ultramarathon, I realized there was that
I had a gap in a very specific skill. That skill was being able to express my thoughts in a coherent matter to others.
Not being able to convey that something is not right about a design, requirement, or code. This fact was almost
immediately apparent to me.

This was something that I had not learned about in school, nor did I expect this. I would be able to look at something,
have a feeling that it is not correct, but was not able to pin-point the issue. Which would then in turn make it almost
impossible to convey this to another person. How could I express something to somebody else, if I myself do not full
understand the issue.

Looking back at this initial problem, I think it might have been an artifact of me being at the very beginning of my
programming journey. Everything was shiny and new, and I wanted to do everything right!

# Accidentally Breaking The Communication Barrier

At the time, I know that I wanted to make myself better at my career, however I had no idea what to do. What I was
missing was the _next big idea_ to work on. Some project that I could spend my time totally focused on that would build
my skills.

In the end, I did come up with an idea. Which was, "I am going to consume as much information as I possibly can."
When the topics are interesting, learning is just a positive side effect. I vividly remember when I started to listen
to [Software Engineering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/), the feeling of, _I do not know anything, and the amount of
information out there to consume is humongous_.

I took that as a hint, and should double down on my ability to consume information. I made it a point to become better
at reading and listening to what other people have to say. Having only a limited amount of free time between commitments
such as: work, sleep, exercise, and eating. Means that I had to learn how to densely pack in education, and still be
able to retain it. Thankfully, we live in a world with technology, and people who like to speak words about interesting
stuff.

This means that most of my knowledge has been consumed in the form of audio, ranging from videos lectures, audiobooks,
and podcasts. The shear weight of knowing that I would probably be spending years to get to where I want to be, was
heavy. So the revelation of _consume faster_ was my goal. Consuming information was all I had at the time, so why not be
really good at that? Since most of the information I wanted was on the audio medium, most player have a speed-up
function.

Something that I picked up during my video game phase, was how to acclimate to higher sensitivity. Most video games
allow you to control the mouse or joystick sensitivity. If you have a high sensitivity, you have the ability to react
quicker. In my case, it was point and shoot. Nothing like snapping 180 degrees and destroying the person behind you.
Well, in order for me to get to the point where my movements where quick because I had high sensitivity, I had to
incrementally work up. I would start a day, and I would bump up the mouse sensitivity to a step where, it was higher
than I was used to and a bit uncomfortable. I would spend matches getting used to not overdoing my movements. Once I
felt like I was starting to get the hang of it, I would then bump up the sensitivity and repeat the process. I would
keep going until I either maxed out the sensitivity scale, or did not see any improvement overtime.

Turns out that same process works for speeding up audio. Start by bumping up the playback speed of the audio. This new
speed requires more focus on what is being said and comprehending the topic at hand. Which limits the amount of things
you can do at a time. I would repeat the process of, once things got comfortable, bump it up a little. This process
repeated until I found where if it was set any faster, then listening is the only thing I could do. The playback speed
of x2.35 is where my limit is. Anything faster and I have to sit down and just listen to comprehend the subject at hand.
Which means I cannot do other things require less focus: going on really long walks, washing my car, and driving.
