Very early into my professional software development career and just before my 1500+ days of dedicated work. There was a
realization sudden realization of a gap in a very specific skill. Which was being able to express my thoughts in a
coherent matter to others. A lack the ability to convey meaning about something that is not right about: a design,
requirement, or code. It was almost immediately apparent to me once I started to work.

This was something that I had not learned about in school, nor was the expectation its encounter. Yes, learning how to
speak in public while delivering an outlined speech was covered. However, being able to quickly convey meaning, on the
spot, was not. I would be able to look at something, have a feeling that it is not correct, but was not able to
pin-point the issue. Which in-turn makes it almost impossible to communicate this to another person. How could I express
something to somebody else, if I myself do not full understand the issue?

Looking back, I think it might have been an artifact of me being at the very beginning of my programming journey.
Everything was new and fascinating, and I wanted to do everything right! All without having the proper know-how,
guidelines, or heuristics.

# Accidentally Breaking The Communication Barrier

### The Consumer

At the time, goal to make myself better at my career was crystal clear. Going about and making that a reality, was not.
It felt like there was a missing piece of the puzzle, which would bridge the gap between where I was now and where I
wanted to be. Having the _next big project_ to work on, was what I thought I needed. Finding the investment of time,
such that remaining totally focused on, would yield honed career skills.

In the end, I did come up with an idea. Which was, "I am going to consume as much information as I possibly can."
When the topics are interesting, learning becomes a positive side effect instead of be the primary result.
A [flashbulb memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashbulb_memory) occurred after the discovery
of [Software Engineering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/). The feeling of, _I do not know anything, and the amount of
information out there to consume will take years to finish_.

This was interpreted as a hint, that I should double down on the ability to consume information. A point was made to
become better at reading and listening to what other people have to say. Having only a limited amount of free time
between commitments such as: work, sleep, exercise, and eating. Meant that learning how to densely pack in education and
still be able to retain it, was a must-have skill. Thankfully, we live in a world with technology, and people who like
to speak words about interesting stuff.

Therefore, most of my knowledge has been consumed via audio, ranging from videos lectures, audiobooks, and podcasts. The
vast weight of knowing that I would probably be spending years to get to where I want to be, was heavy. Thankfully it
was not soul crushing. _Consume faster_ quickly became part of this knowledge hoarding goal. Taking information was all
I had at the time, so why not be really good at that? Since most of the information desired is emitted from audio
players, the ability to have a speed-up function was a must.

Something that I picked up during my video game phase, was how to acclimate to higher control sensitivity. Most video
games allows the controls the mouse or joystick's sensitivity to be adjusted. Having a high sensitivity, enables the
ability to react quicker. In my case, it was point and shoot. Nothing like snapping 180 degrees and destroying the
opponent behind you. In order to reach the point where my movements where quick, I learned that I had to incrementally
work up. Each day would start where the sensitivity of the mouse would bump up to a step where, it was higher than I was
used to and a bit uncomfortable. Spending matches getting used heightened feedback system while trying to not overdoing
my movements. Overtime, once I felt like I was starting to get the hang of it, I would then bump up the sensitivity and
repeat the process. This process would keep going until either control configuration was maxed, or there was not any
noticeable improvement in performance over time.

As it turns out, that same process works for speeding up audio. Start by bumping up the playback speed of the audio.
This new speed requires more focus on what is being said and comprehending the topic at hand. Which limits the amount of
things, other than listening, that could be done at the same time. I would repeat the process of, once things got
comfortable, bump it up a little. This process repeated until if it where any faster, then listening is the only thing
that could be done at the time. The playback speed of x2.35 is where my limit is. Anything faster requires me to sit
down and just listen to the subject at hand. Which means other tasks that require less focus such as:
going on really long walks, washing my car, and driving, get thrown out the window.

There was a brief period of time when I would consume analog books. The biggest problem with books, is the sitting down
in one place and not doing anything aspect. Programming has me stationary in front of a computer for the most of my
time. Therefore, sitting down in one place and consuming is book becomes difficult, because I need to move. Albeit, I
would take advantage of times when I should be sitting down and not expected to be doing anything. Such as, when laundry
is being done. Those tasks are far and few in-between. Making audiobooks the superior choice, because I can do low
impact tasks while consuming knowledge.

## The Producer

Somewhere in this timeline, I felt bad about my entire knowledge base being unoriginal and just borrowed wisdom from
others. As if all of my thoughts where unoriginal and not worth sharing. As life continued, the realization that it is
the combination of everything that I consume which gives me a unique perspective of the world. Since my time is not
infinite, I can only dedicate my attention to a small subset of information provided by others. The knowledge pool
created by humanity is vast and expansive. The combination of learning I picked by the luck of the draw, forms a picture
of the world that only I have. Until we reach singularity, where anyone knows everything and anything at a given time, I
still have something to unique contribute.

If you are curious, and want to take a slice of the same thoughts I have taken from others, feel free to browse my book
collection.

Now I did not originally forget the topic of the section, _accidentally breaking the communication barrier_. The stage
has been set for it though, because here is how it happened. The piece of the puzzle that that was missing was, other
people's perspectives. As I consumed more and more of others' opinions and teachings of the world, the more my own
thoughts became clear. Acting as a catalyst for me being able to speak comprehensibly about a topic. Hearing about how
somebody else has the same feelings, but was able to communicate it better, resonated with me. This in turn created a
positive feedback loop. The more I consumed, the better I became at communicating with others.

### Exercises in Communication

#### Starting a blog

There was a feeling of something missing in my efforts. I was hoarding knowledge others so kindly spent the time giving
out, and was not giving any that back. Which eventually lead me to the very beginning of
my [GitHub contribution streak](https://github.com/Unthrottled). The very one I am trying to escape.

This got me hooked into doing showing to show that I had accomplished something every day. Previously, I had tried to
get myself into a habit of bettering my skills as a software developer, but those faded out. Mostly because of the lack
of interesting ideas or problems to solve.

It took copious amounts of knowledge consumption to discover that I could write about my own technical experiences.
Problems that had to solved, without a convenient answer of the Google machine. Thus, https://blog.unthrottled.io
was born, marking the start of something that would consume a large portion of my attention and require truckloads
discipline. All without having any exit plan or knowing when this goal of self-improvement has been reached.

Writing a blog was a positive experience. It increased my ability to write more coherent emails, and convey my feelings
with written words better. However, I stopped contributing to it after I figured out that building things with new
technology was cooler. A couple of months after starting, I had stopped writing blog posts. This was in trade for
writing new applications. Fairly confident this was when I found [Software Engineering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/)
, because that podcast showed me a new world of neat technology. I wanted hands-on experience with the cutting edge
tools that the cool kids where using. It also meant that I had to do this on my free time as well, because at the time I
was working for the government, and we were still writing SOAP services.

This new trend of building new applications would continue into early 2018, and quickly change when I started my next
career. Around this time, I was searching for new things to learn, because the technical stack I was working with was
different. New technology, new challenges, and more things to learn. It was also around this time I
discovered [combining Anime Girls & software development tools](c_theperfecttheme) and that
I [should get better at math](b_machinelearning). Needless to say, my direct dedication to getting better at
communicating took a backseat. It was still important and still gets attention, but it was not the main goal that
deserved my complete attention.

#### Presenting Technical Topics

Although that was the end of blog journey, the desire to share things that I have learned overtime and before-hand still
existed. There was an opportunity, at my new job, to be able to present on technical topics to an audience of coworkers.
The thought of giving a presentation to an audience in person, was an uncomfortable feeling at first. By this time, I
knew to gravitate towards activities that make me uncomfortable, but will yield positive results in the end. Meaning
that I dove into task, and have eventually reached a point where giving talks is second nature. Granted they take a
monumental amount of effort and practice, but the end-result is worth it.

The following paragraphs are dedicated to a small subset of topics I have presented on.

Adopting [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) and the
non-blocking [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html)
before starting my new job, gave me an opportunity to share this growing tech with my co-workers. I had a good grasp on
how these new and strange programming paradigms worked. Also, explaining these new concepts these paradigms was
difficult using only words. Then I remembered that I can use my skills to build things with computers to explain stuff.
Thus, https://learn-functional.unthrottled.io/ was born! The primary reason this needed to be built, was to explain the
concepts of reactive
programming [using animations](https://learn-functional.unthrottled.io/reactive/concepts/reactor/visualisations/intermediate/zipWith)
. It also helped solidify my understanding of the topics as well, because I used the same programming constructs to
implement the animations!

Part of the new tech stack at my new job was [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). Doing anything, at the
time, in AWS was scary and there were walls of documentation. In this case, quantity did not equal quality. To AWS's
credit, they have been doing a better job on their documentation. I was curious about how to host my own things, I
already knew about containers and the cloud. Thus, I started to dive into the world of AWS. After picking up some handy
tips that I had not known before, I felt the need to create https://frugal-aws.unthrottled.io/
Which documents my process of how I supported my very own production.

There was also a time, where I wanted to escape from my contribution streak, and I thought I knew how to do it. I was
confident that the answer was tracking my time in some other way, other than writing code and pushing it to GitHub.
[SOGoS](https://github.com/Unthrottled/SOGoS-ui) was born, and became a pet project. It was destined to pull me out of
the hole I dug myself into. Long story short, that did not
work, [you can read more of the story here.](../reflections/durationnotgood) Anyways, I did learn new things that where
difficult to figure out by myself. Like using the really cheap, but really
confusing [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/). So I created some slides and gave a presentation to all who
where interested. You can find the slides of the talk, here:
https://unthrottled.github.io/cognito-an-oauth-story/#/

## In Conclusion

Restating an important point, for emphasis. While my direct journey where improving my communication with others has
left the direct spotlight. I am always looking for ways to hone that skill. Take this memoir for instance, it's a bunch
of words, that is difficult to write, and I am conveying my life story. If that is not communication, then I guess I
need a reality check.
