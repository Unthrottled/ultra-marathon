Very early into my professional software development career, some time before my 1500+ days of dedicated work. A gap in
a very specific skill made itself known. Being able to express my thoughts in a coherent matter to others was difficult.
I lacked the ability to convey meaning about something which was right about: a design, requirement, or chunk of code.

This was something that I had not learned about in school, nor was there an expectation encounter this. Yes, learning
how to speak in public, for delivering a prepared speech, was covered. However, being able to quickly convey meaning, on
the spot, was not. I would be able to look at something, have a feeling that it is not optimal, but was not able to
pinpoint the issue. Which in-turn makes it almost impossible to communicate this to another person. How could I express
something to somebody else, if I do not full understand the issue as well?

Looking back, I think it might have been an artifact of me being at the very beginning of my programming journey.
Everything was new and fascinating, and I wanted to do everything right! All without having the proper know-how,
guidelines, or heuristics.

# Accidentally Breaking The Communication Barrier

### The Consumer

At the time, goal to make myself better at my career was crystal clear. Making that a reality, was not. It felt like
there was a missing piece in the puzzle. Something which would bridge the gap between where I was now and where I wanted
to be. Having the _next big project_ to work on. Finding an investment of time which would yield honed career skills, if
enough time and effort was thrown at it.

In the end, I did come up with an idea. Which was, "I am going to consume as much information as I possibly can."
When the topics are interesting, learning becomes a positive side effect instead of be the primary objective.
A [flashbulb memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashbulb_memory) occurred shortly after the discovery of
the [Software Engineering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/) podcast. I vividly remember the feeling of, _I do not know
anything, and the amount of information out there, will take years to finish_.

This was interpreted as a hint, that I should double down on the ability to consume information. Refining the skils to
become better at listening to what other people have to say. Having only a limited amount of free time between
commitments such as: work, sleep, exercise, and eating, required me to hone a specific skill. Which was being able to
densely pack in education and still be able to retain it, within a small time-slot. Thankfully, we live in a world with
technology, and people who like to speak words about interesting stuff.

Therefore, most of my knowledge has been consumed via audio, ranging from videos lectures, audiobooks, and podcasts. The
vast weight of knowing that I would probably be spending years to get to where I want to be, was heavy. Thankfully it
was not soul crushing, yet. _Consume faster_ quickly became part of my knowledge hoarding goal. Taking information in
was all I had at the time, so why not be really good at that? Since most of the information desired is emitted from
audio players, the ability for my resources to have a speed-up function, was a must.

Something that I picked up during my video game phase, was how to acclimate to higher control sensitivity. Most video
games allows the controls the mouse or joystick's sensitivity to be adjusted. Having a high sensitivity, enables the
ability to react quicker. In my case, it was point and shoot. Nothing like snapping a full 180 degrees and destroying
the opponent behind you. In order to reach the point where my movements where quick, I learned that I had to
incrementally work up. Each day I would start with the sensitivity of the mouse at a level higher than I was used to and
a bit uncomfortable. Spending matches getting used heightened feedback system. Overtime, once I felt like I was starting
to get the hang of it, I would then bump up the sensitivity and repeat the process. This process would keep going until
either control configuration was maxed, or there was not any noticeable improvement in performance over time.

As it turns out, that same process works for speeding up audio. Start by bumping up the playback speed of the audio.
This new speed requires more focus on what is being said and comprehending the topic at hand. Which limits the amount of
tasks that could be done at the same time as listening. I would repeat the process bumping up playback speed when I got
comfortable. This process repeated until if it where any faster, then listening is the only thing that could be done at
the time. The playback speed of x2.35 is where my limit is. Anything faster requires me to sit down and just listen to
the subject at hand. Which means other tasks that require less focus such as:
going on really long walks, washing my car, and driving, get thrown out the window. Which is a no-go, and defeats the
purpose.

There was a brief period of time when I would consume analog books. The biggest problem with books, is the sitting down
in one place and not doing anything aspect. Programming has me stationary in front of a computer for the most of my
time. Therefore, sitting down in one place and consuming is book becomes difficult, because I need to move. There where
few opportunities were I could take advantage of times I _should_ be sitting down and not doing anything. Such as, when
laundry is being done. Those tasks are far and few in-between though. Making audiobooks the superior choice, because I
can do low impact tasks while consuming knowledge.

## The Producer

Somewhere in this timeline, I felt bad about my entire knowledge-base being unoriginal and just borrowed wisdom from
others. As if all of my thoughts where unoriginal and not worth sharing. Eventually, it was the realization that the sum
of everything that I have consumed which me a unique perspective of the world. Since my time (and yours) is not
infinite, I can only dedicate my attention to a small subset of information. The knowledge pool created by humanity is
vast and expansive. Therefore, things I have chosen to consume were essentially picked by the luck of the draw. Forming
a picture of the world that is unique to me. Until we reach singularity, where anyone knows everything and anything at a
given time, I still have something to unique contribute.

Before I continue, if you also would like to read the same things I have read. Feel free to browse through some of these
book recommendations. This is a distilled list of worth-while reads. I would not recommend you junk.

Before going any further, **no** I did not originally forget the topic of this section, "_accidentally breaking the
communication barrier_." I have just been busy setting the stage, because now I get to tell you how it happened.

Turns out, the piece of the puzzle which missing was: other people's perspectives. As I consumed more and more of other
people's opinions or teachings, the more my own thoughts became clear. Acting as a catalyst for me to be able to speak
comprehensibly about a topic. Hearing somebody else having problem/issue and solving it, but being able to communicate
it better, resonated with me. This in turn created a positive feedback loop. The more I consumed, the better I became at
communicating with others.

### Exercises in Communication

#### Starting a blog

I was hoarding knowledge others so kindly spent the time giving out, and was not giving any that back. Which eventually
lead me to the very beginning of
my [GitHub contribution streak](https://github.com/Unthrottled?tab=overview&from=2017-12-01&to=2017-12-31). <sup>_The
very one I am trying to escape._</sup>

This is what got me hooked into showing others that I am accomplishing something every day. Previously, I had tried to
get myself into a habit of bettering my skills as a software developer, but those faded out. Mostly because of the lack
of interesting ideas or problems to solve.

It took copious amounts of knowledge consumption to discover that I could write about my own technical experiences. I
encountered problems that other people haven not asked about. Therefore the Google machine could not give me a
convenient answer. Thus, https://blog.unthrottled.io was born, marking the start of something that would consume a large
portion of my attention and require truckloads discipline. All without having any exit plan or knowing when this goal of
self-improvement will have been reached.

Writing a blog was a positive experience. It increased my ability to write more coherent emails, and convey my feelings
with written words better. However, I stopped contributing to it after I figured out that building things with new
technology was cooler. A couple of months after starting, I had stopped writing blog posts. Trading it by spending time
writing applications using emerging technologies. I am fairly confident this was when I
found [Software Engineering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/), because that podcast showed me a new world of neat tools.
I wanted hands-on experience with the cutting edge software that the cool kids where using. It also meant that I had to
do this on my free time as well. Because at the time I was working for the government, and we were still writing SOAP
services.

This new trend of building new applications would continue into early 2018, and quickly change when I started my next
career. Around this time, I was searching for new things to learn, because the technical stack I was working with was
different. New technology, new challenges, and more things to learn. Also around this time I discovered that I
could [combine Anime Girls & software development tools](c_theperfecttheme) and that
I [should get better at math](b_machinelearning). Needless to say, my direct dedication to getting better at
communicating took a backseat. This goal is still important and gets my attention sometimes. However, it is not my
primary goal anymore.

#### Presenting Technical Topics

Although that was the end of blog journey, I still desire to share things learned. There was an opportunity, at my new
job, to be able to present on technical topics to an audience of coworkers. The thought of giving a presentation to an
audience, in-person, was an uncomfortable feeling. I gravitate towards activities that make me uncomfortable, because
they tend to yield net positive results. Eventually, I reached a point where giving talks feels like second nature.
Though they still take a monumental amounts of effort and practice, have become a comfortable activity.

The following paragraphs are dedicated to a small subset of topics I have presented on.

I adopted [reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) and the
non-blocking [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html)
before starting my new job. This gave me an opportunity to share this emerging tech with my co-workers. I had a good
grasp on how these new and strange programming paradigms functioned. Explaining the new concepts, this library
introduces, is difficult using only words. Thus, https://learn-functional.unthrottled.io/ was born! It is a website,
built to was to explain the concepts of reactive
programming [using animations](https://learn-functional.unthrottled.io/reactive/concepts/reactor/visualisations/intermediate/zipWith)
. It also helped solidify my understanding of the topics as well, because it uses the same programming constructs to
implement the animations!

Part of the new tech stack at my new job is [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). Doing anything (at the time)
in AWS was scary. There were walls of documentation, but in this case, quantity did not equal quality. To AWS's credit,
they have been doing a better job on their documentation. I was curious about how to host my own things, I already knew
about containers and the cloud. So I started to dive into the world of AWS. After picking up some handy tips that I had
not known before, I felt the need to create https://frugal-aws.unthrottled.io/
Which documents my process of how I supported my very own production.

This lovingly crafted journal is not the first time I have wanted to escape from my software contribution streak. Back
then, I thought I knew how to do it as well. I was confident that the answer was tracking my time in some other way,
other than writing code and pushing it to GitHub. [SOGoS](https://github.com/Unthrottled/SOGoS-ui) was born, and became
a pet project. It was destined to pull me out of the hole I dug myself into. Long story short, that did not
work, [you can read more of the story here.](../reflections/durationnotgood) Anyway, in the process of building that
project, I did learn new things that where difficult to figure out by myself. Like using the really cheap, but really
confusing [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/). So I created some slides and gave a presentation to all who
where interested. You can find the slides of the talk, here:
https://unthrottled.github.io/cognito-an-oauth-story/#/

## In Conclusion

Restating an important point, for emphasis. While my direct journey where improving my communication with others has
left the direct spotlight. I am always looking for ways to hone this skill. Take this memoir for instance, it's a bunch
of words, that is difficult to write, and I am conveying my life story.
