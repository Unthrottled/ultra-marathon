Very early into my professional career and just before my ultramarathon, I realized there was that I had a gap in a very specific skill. That skill
was being able to express my thoughts in a coherent matter to others. Not being able to convey that something is not
right about a design, requirement, or code. This fact was almost immediately apparent to me.

This was something that I had not learned about in school, nor did I expect this. I would be able to look at something,
have a feeling that it is not correct, but was not able to pin-point the issue. Which would then in turn make it almost
impossible to convey this to another person. How could I express something to somebody else, if I myself do not full
understand the issue.

Looking back at this initial problem, I think it might have been an artifact of me being at the very beginning of my
programming journey. Everything was shiny and new, and I wanted to do everything right!
