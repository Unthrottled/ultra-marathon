Early into my journey, I learned and strongly believed in a very important fact: "I can do anything if I set my mind to
it." There is a catch though, "given enough time and effort." Which is very important, because that is necessary for
managing expectations. Life is all about managing expectations. If I was expecting to be able to understand linear
algebra calculus, without having a firm grasp of the prerequisites, in a short period of time. Then I was setting myself
up for heaps of disappointment. However, if I was expecting that it would take me a year or more of dedicated study to
accomplish that task. Then I could start to see myself actually being able to accomplish that objective. It would take a
lot of time, work, and effort, but I could do it.

# Machine Learning

There was a day when I realized that I might be in trouble. I had just watched a presentation on what neat things people
can do with artificial intelligence and machine learning. I was also still paying attention to what other people had to
say about new developments in technology. The feeling that the future involves more data-centric and machine provided
solution was very strong. I wanted to remain in a position, where I could still make contribution to that new future.
However, the sinking feeling that I was getting was because I knew a very heavy fact. My math skills where awful. How
could I expect to make machines dance, if I lack a strong foundation in mathematics?

I was able to skate by college with a shoddy foundation of math, created by neglect in my early learning days. I knew I
had to re-build my foundational understands in order to have any semblance of success in these data science fields. At
least, that is what I thought at the time. The only way forward that I could see, was to re-learn all the basics and
work my way back up to a level where I could do something interesting. That way, I could have the confidence, that I do
indeed have the strong foundational knowledge to attempt anything machine learning related.

At the base of the mountain, and really long road up, was where I knew I was at. The goal was to be able to comfortable
understand, complete, and pass the exams provided by
the [MIT Linear Algebra course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) so that I
could start taking all the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/). In order to get there, I had to build up my foundational
knowledge that I knew I lacked.

### Human Learning

I had to leave my ego at the door, and fully embrace that my math skills where that of a child.
Thankfully, there is an amazing resource, that help children learn maths online https://www.khanacademy.org.

Here is the learning track that I followed to get me to a place to take linear algebra offered by MIT:

- Algebra I
- Geometry
- Algebra II
- Trigonometry
- Pre-Caculus
- Statistics & Probability
- Differential Calculus
- Linear Algebra
