I spent a bunch of time with myself whether it be: meditating, walking long distances, lifting heavy things, and a
plethora of other activities. These activities given me the opportunity to be able to look back at the past, begin to
piece together who I am. In hopes to find a shape or outline of my yet undefined future.

Most of my existential thoughts occur as I am walking, wandering around town with no destination. This is the perfect
opportunity to let my mind be free. Thoughts that tend to occur are about what I want out of life. Walking is probably
one of the few moments in time, where nothing else really matters. Nothing is expected of me, and I can let my mind
wander, like my body. This used to be prime time for consuming audiobooks. However, once I have left that phase in my
life, it became a chunk of time to just hang out with myself. Occasionally, I have a craving for stimulation, and pop in
a constructive audio-book or podcast. For the most part, in my current stage of life, it is just a potluck of music.

I enjoy this so much, I do not let anything stop me once I have set my mind to it. I have walked through snow storms,
massive rain downpours, and ridiculous heat waves. Almost nothing will prevent me from participating in one of my
favorite activities. Something that will stop me is ther was a long walk the day before. I eventually learned I need
another hobby, because I cannot walk long distances every day, and expect not to abuse my body.

That is one of the many reflections I have come across in my journey seeking self actualization. Join me as I dive
deeper into the more significant findings of my ultramarathon.
