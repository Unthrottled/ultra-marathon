Having spent a bunch of time with myself, whether it be: meditating, walking long distances, lifting heavy things, and a
plethora of other activities. Has given me the opportunity to look back at the past, begin to piece together who I am,
and shape my undefined future.

Most of my existential thoughts occur as I am walking, wandering around town with no destination. I get the opportunity
to let my mind be free, and I tend think about what it is I want out of life. It is probably one of the few moments in
time, where nothing else really matters. Nothing is expected of me, and I can let my mind wander like my body is
currently doing. It used to be prime time for consuming audiobooks. However, once I have left that phase in my life, it
became a time to just hang out with myself. Occasionally, I have a craving for stimulation, and pop in a constructive
audio-book or podcast. For the most part, in my current stage of life, it is just the potluck of music I listen to.

I enjoy this so much, I do not let anything stop me once I have set my mind to it. Be it: snow, rain, heat, cold, or
anything else, will not prevent me from participating in one of my favorite activities. The fact that walking is a low
impact exercise, does not mean that it is something I can do every day.

I learned real quick that I need another hobby, because I cannot walk long distances every day, and expect not to abuse
my body. That is one of the many reflections I have come across in my journey to find the best version of myself. Join
me as I dive deeper into the more significant findings of my ultramarathon.
