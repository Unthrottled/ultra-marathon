# Unlocking Potential

### Nothing Extraordinary

For the large majority of my school years, I was not anything special. The good kid that never got in trouble or had
terrible grades. There were times when after-school tutoring and school work was required to get by. Those one-off
issues were tolerable. Being called an honor's student, never happened to me. Trying hard was a foreign and undesired
concept. Nothing about me was remarkable at the time, and that was okay, I just existed. I had things, at the time, that
made me happy. Having a personal little bubble meant that life was easy and care-free.

The future was something that had no pressing weight and had very little of my concern. Not knowing what to expect from
life or even what my college major should be, was not a source of stress. Why figure it out now, when it can be solved
later? Most problems get an answer once you wait long enough. Besides, everybody else has the same problem, right?

Once higher education entered the picture, its courses were treated with the same work ethic as high school. The first
few semesters resulted in _below average_ performance. Marking the moment when the pressure of my current standing in
life began to feel real. A rude awakening of the sorts. There was now a need to put in the effort to complete
assignments and study. In order to pass and get to some place in life. Where that place was exactly, remained unknown.
However, I knew slacking off was not how I get there.

Since, I was a mediocre student throughout my career, scholarships for my higher-level education were out of the
question. This scholastic ride was on my parent's dime, and I was not doing a very good job. Though I am sure that they
were happy to provide the opportunity. Under-preforming, due to a lack of trying, is not the best way to show gratitude.
In addition, remaining employed as a fast-food clerk/cook at KFC or a janitor at the local grocery store was not part of
my long-term life goals either.

There have been plenty of stories from my various shift managers which relayed things like: "Stay in school" or "keep
good grades". Those words never really resonated at the time. Even though I understood the meaning, I was not listening.
Once my school performance started to dip, those messages began to have more impact. Everything was adding up, and I was
in need of a change.

### Actually applying myself

The next semester after this realization, was an opportunity to actually apply myself. Trying for once to put the time
and effort into understanding the material and completing assignments.

Thankfully, the semester ended with good marks and even a place onto the Dean's list. Looking back now, the thought of
both putting the time and effort, and still failing, is a scary prospect. Knowing that no matter how hard I tried, not
being able to succeed, would be life crushing. If this was the case, most of the stories about to be told would have
never happened. Knowing that I am fortunate enough to be able to apply myself and see results, has been something I have
taken for granted.

After the semester ended with good marks, something occurred that a bit unexpected. Making an honours list was an
achievement that made both of my parents happy. In fact, I was rewarded with a laptop and a new school bag for this
accomplishment. For all I knew, I was avoiding having a mediocre life. Being given material goods and attention was a
pleasant experience.

This trend continued for the rest of my stay at community college. With time at university quickly moving into the
scope. I was grateful that I eventually figured out what I wanted to study. The decision was something to do with
computers or related to computers.

At the time, my folks where still doing a fair amount of the "grown-up leg-work" for me. Meaning that my mother did all
administrative work into getting me into university. While I am grateful that she did that (thanks Mom!), it also
further postponed the need for me to own adult responsibilities.

That being said, going into this experience, I knew university was the _real deal_. The weight of not getting any
scholarships or being a model student, started to feel really heavy.

> To re-iterate, reflecting now as an adult, this was something that I should have not felt as bad as I should have.
> Yes, trying and getting a partial ride with scholarships would have been nice. However, my folks did not make out as a big deal.
> In fact, they never really said anything about it, or gave me a really hard time about it.
> Going to college was just something that was provided for me, and am grateful for that.

This was the big leagues, not just the "extended high-school program" 2-year college felt like. I entered university
with my newly forming work ethic and a desire to succeed. I was no longer working hard for material things or a
high-paying job, but to make my parent's more proud of me (_and to not have to work for minimum wage the rest of my
life_).

University was a brand-new experience and a really stirred up the waters of my life. There was a need to responsible for
myself, because I was flying solo for the first time. Also, there was the fact that I could not mess up my grades. There
is a saying: "Getting Good Grades, Sleep, and a Social Life, pick two." Well, I chose the first two, not that my social
life was blooming social life to start off with. In turn, the first two semesters ended with high marks. Again, really
grateful that I can apply time and effort can yield positive results. The cherry on top was, I enjoyed the major I was
given.

Since this was university, I did not have summer classes like I did back in college. By the time the 3rd year of higher
education strolled in, I had the late realization of, "I should get an internship." The technical folks at Dad's
workplace were nice enough to take me in for the summer to learn. I even got paid for the experience!

I discovered a vast amount the vast of unknown topics. The entire summer was spent picking up new concepts that I have
never even heard of before or was taught. I would like to think that I also did a good job in the process, because they
let me come back over winter break and the next summer.

Though I did not know it at the start, but that summer previewed the beginning of something great. My current chapter in
life (the one I am in as I write this) started to appear from behind the horizon.

### The Point of Inflection

By this time, the past few years of actually applying myself got me hooked on performance. Being fulfilled was strong
and _very_ desirable feeling. Becoming great was driven by what felt like an insatiable appetite. By this time, I
already subconsciously knew that I needed to change who I was if I wanted to make up for my unremarkable past life.
Therefore, I guess past me thought that part of that was loosing 140lbs (63kilos). There really was not a specific day
or reason for the change. It just happened. Over the course of a year, I just barely ate enough food to get by. Learning
first-hand that weight can be lost without exercising. Though the weight was lost, there was also a gain of a very
unhealthy relationship with food. Which took me a solid 5 years afterwords to overcome. I went from:

- Eating until I was more than full, because I was hungry.
- Not eating anything enough.
- Overly high-strung food-prepper.
- Not caring because I know my body now and how it behaves (for the most part).

That is a story for another day, and I will leave it as such. The important point is that Fall 2013 became the precursor
to the unknowing start of my "High-Octane" life chapter. At the end of the Summer 2014, I was a now skinny-fat 160lb
(73kg). I changed myself enough to where I felt like I could actually work out. So Fall 2014, my last semester of
university (the fifth one if you are counting), marked the start of my athletic phase. There was a singular goal, which
was to be able to do one chin-up.

A chin-up is the variant of the body-weight pull-down exercise where the bar is gripped overhead with the palms facing
in and the elbows are pointed away from the body. It is the bicep-centric variant of this pull exercise. (The pull-up is
the variant where the palms face outwards and the elbows travel into the sides of the body at the top of the motion).

Being obese growing up, it was something I was never able to do. There was a vivid memory of when I first started
working out which was: "I wish I started sooner, that way everything (right now) would not be as difficult."
Having a head start would have been nice, however everybody has to start somewhere. Instead, I had to pay down being
sedentary, with large amounts of effort. Curling any weight more than 12lbs was a struggle. Somehow, I expected to be
able to hold onto and pull down 80lbs (36kg) with each hand. It took a solid 5 months of working out for me to be able
to perform one chin-up.

The completion of the fall semester 2014 cemented how I wanted to (and am still) currently living my life. I was able to
complete university with my head held high. In fact, I remember feeling super confident about my last test that I ever
took at university. Not having to cram at the last minute like some my other classmates. I already spent the
time and knew the material. That feeling of being in control and knowing I aced my last exam of my educational career,
was a savory memory. In addition, I was working out and be able to accomplish things I never thought possible.

Life satisfaction is amazing, and I yearned for more. That feeling of accomplishment and knowing what I can do anything,
if I have a purpose. It validated the past 3 years of hard labor to complete higher level education. I was hooked, and I
knew how the next significant portion of my life should be spent. The desire to know what I am fully capable of
accomplishing, drove that decision. An attempt to make up for the previous 7 years I never really tried at anything
important.

> Note, I do not count time when I was in 6th grade or younger. Nobody expects anything amazing from an 12-year-old.

I desired to see where my full potential lies. If I had run myself into the ground to get it, so be it. I would gladly
pick myself back up and ask for more. Purposely seeking out difficult challenges to see how I measure up to my
expectations. This meant I spent a fair amount time by myself. Gravitating to areas/challenges where others move away
from, mostly because it is really uncomfortable. The experiences that I have put myself to, deserve their own story and
will be saved for a later article.

At the time of this writing, it has been over 9 years since I realized that I can apply myself and succeed. While it has
been 7 years since becoming a hyper-focused self-improvement zealot. About 4 of those I have dedicated to my career
building _ultramarathon_.

Join me, as I share lessons learned from trying really hard to find my limits in hopes of reaching a semblance
self-actualization.
