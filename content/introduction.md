# Unlocking Potential

For the large majority of my school years, I was not anything special.
I was a good kid, never got in trouble or had terribly bad grades.
I try to forget some of the after-school tutoring and work that needed to be done from time to time. That being said, I also was not a model student either, I never really tried very hard in my life. Nothing about me was remarkable and at the time, and that was okay. I just existed and I had things, at the time, that made me happy. I was in my own little bubble, and things where chill. I never really worried too much about the future. I had no idea what I wanted to do for my major/life, and that did not bother me too much. Why figure it out now, when I can solve it later? Most problems get an answer once you wait long enough.

The way I treated school remained the same when I graduated highschool.
It was a bit of an awakening, because I did not do very well my first few semesters. That was when I started to feel the pressure of my current standing in life. I actually need to apply myself to pass and get to some place.
I had not figured out where that place was, but I knew this is not how I get there.

Since, I was an unremarkable student throughout my career, I did not attend higher level education on scholarship. I was riding on my parent's dime, and I was not doing a very good job. Remaining employed as a fast-food clerk/cook at KFC or a janitor at the local grocery store was not part of my long-term life goals either. I heard a bunch of stories from shift managers that I worked with that said, "Stay in school" and "keep good grades". Though I was not really listening at the time, those words started to have more impact once I started doing poorly at school.

The next semester after my realization, I actually started to apply myself.
I tried for once and actually put the work into understanding the material and completing assignments. As a result, my grades improved and I even made it onto the Dean's list. Though I did not know at the time, but making an honours list made Mom and Dad happy. In fact, I was rewarded with a laptop and a new school bag for my achievement. I was given something for trying and I was not even expecting a reward. To me, I was avoiding mediocrity.

Being given material goods and attention was a pleasant experience that I wanted again. That trend continued for the rest of my stay at community college.
However, my purpose for getting good grades had changed when I entered my 2 years at university. I had already decided that I wanted to do something computer related, so my mother did all the leg work into getting me into university. Further postponing the my ownership of adult responsibilities.

That being said, I knew university was the _real deal_.
Felt the weight of not getting any scholarships or being a model student, even more. This was the big leagues, not just the extended high-school program the 2 year college felt like. I entered university with my newly forming work ethic though, on the back of my parent's dime. I was no longer working hard for material things, but to make my parent's more proud of me.

Needless to say, university was a brand new experience.
I was responsible for myself, I was alone for the first time, _and_ I could not mess up my grades. There is a saying: "Good Grades, Sleep, and a Social Life, pick two." Well, I chose the first two, not that I had a blooming social life to start off with. So my first two semesters, I did really well in all of my courses. The cherry on top was I enjoyed the major I was given.

Since this was university, I did not have summer classes like I did back in college. It was my 3rd year of higher education, and I had the late realization of, "I should get an internship." The technical folks at Dad's workplace were nice enough to take me in for the summer, I even got paid!

Though I did not know it at the time, that summer was the very beginning of my current chapter in life. The realization of the shear amount of things I did not know, dawned on me. I spent the entire summer picking up new concepts I had never even heard of before. I would like to think that I also did a good job in the process, because they let me come back over winter break and the next summer.

By this time, I already sub-consiously knew that I needed to change who I was if I wanted to make up for my unremarkable past life. Therefore, I guess past me thought that part of that was loosing 140lbs (63kilos). There really was not a specific day or reason where I decided to make the change, but it happened. So over the course of a year I just barely ate enough food to get by. I learned that you can loose weight without exercising. I also gained a very unhealthy relationship with food, which took me a solid 5 years to overcome. I went from eating until I was more than full, to not eating anything, to overly high-strung food prepper, to not caring because I know my body now. This is a story for another day, and I will leave it as such. Important point is that fall 2013 was is the unknowing beginning of my high-octane life chapter.

Now that I was a skinny-fat 160lb (73kg), I felt like I could actually work out now. So fall 2014, my last semester of university (the fifth one if you are counting), I started to work out. I had a goal, I wanted to be able to do one chin-up. A chin-up is the variant of the pull down exercise where the palms of the hand are facing in-wards and elbows are away from the body. It is the bicep-centric version of the king  bodyweight pull exercise. The pull-up is the variant where the palms face outwards and the elbows travel into the sides of the body. Being obese growing up, it was something I was never able to do.
I distinctly remember thinking to myself when I first started working out, "I wish I started sooner, that way everthing, right now, would not be as difficult."
Curling any weight more than 12lbs was a struggle. Somehow, I expected to be able to hold onto and pull down 80lbs (36kg) with each hand. It took a solid 5 months of working out for me to be able to perform one chin-up.

It was at the end of the fall semester 2014 that cemented the current projection of how I wanted to live my life. I was able to complete university with my head held high. In fact, I remember feeling super confident about my last test that I ever took at university. Not having to cram at the last minute like others, because I already spent the time and knew the material. That feeling of being in control and knowing I aced my last exam is a savory memory. In addition, working out was amazing, being able to accomplish things I never thought possible. Plus, not feeling like garbage everyday when waking up was a humongous plus.

Life satisfaction is amazing and I wanted more of that. The feeling of accomplishment and knowing I can have a purpose, really solidified the validation of work in the past 3 years of my life. I was hooked, and I knew what I wanted to spend the next significate portion of my life doing. I needed to see what I am fully capable of accomplishing. An attempt to make up for the 7 years I never really tried at anything important.

> Note, I do not count time when I was in 6th grade or younger. Nobody expects anything amazing from an 12 year old.

I want to see where my full potential lies. I would run myself into the ground to get it but, I would pick myself back up and ask for more. Purposely seeking out difficult challenges to see how I measure up. I have spent a lot of time by myself, because of that. I tend to be where nobody else is, because it is really uncomfortable. I will save this story for another article though.

At the time of this writing, it has been over 9 years since I realized that I can apply myself and succeed. While it has been 7 years since becoming a hyper-focused, self-improvement zealot, and about 4 of those I have dedicated to my _ultramarathon_.

Join me as I share lessons learned by trying really hard to find self actualization and seeing what I can handle.
