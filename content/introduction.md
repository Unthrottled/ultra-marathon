# Unlocking Potential

For the large majority of my school years, I was not anything special.
I was a good kid, never got in trouble or had terribly bad grades.
I try to forget some of the after-school tutoring and work that needed to be done from time to time. That being said, I also was not a model student either, I never really tried very hard in my life. Nothing about me was remarkable and at the time, and that was okay. I just existed and I had things, at the time, that made me happy. I was in my own little bubble, and things where chill. I never really worried too much about the future. I had no idea what I wanted to do for my major/life, and that did not bother me too much. Why figure it out now, when I can solve it later? Most problems get an answer once you wait long enough.

The way I treated school remained the same when I graduated highschool.
It was a bit of an awakening, because I did not do very well my first few semesters. That was when I started to feel the pressure of my current standing in life. I actually need to apply myself to pass and get to some place.
I had not figured out where that place was, but I knew this is not how I get there.

Since, I was an unremarkable student throughout my career, I did not attend higher level education on scholarship. I was riding on my parent's dime, and I was not doing a very good job. Remaining employed as a fast-food clerk/cook at KFC or a janitor at the local grocery store was not part of my long-term life goals either. I heard a bunch of stories from shift managers that I worked with that said, "Stay in school" and "keep good grades". Though I was not really listening at the time, those words started to have more impact once I started doing poorly at school.

The next semester after my realization, I actually started to apply myself.
I tried for once and actually put the work into understanding the material and completing assignments. As a result, my grades improved and I even made it onto the Dean's list. Though I did not know at the time, but making an honours list made Mom and Dad happy. In fact, I was rewarded with a laptop and a new school bag for my achievement. I was given something for trying and I was not even expecting a reward. To me, I was avoiding mediocrity.

Being given material goods and attention was a pleasant experience that I wanted again. That trend continued for the rest of my stay at community college.
However, my purpose for getting good grades had changed when I entered my 2 years at university. I had already decided that I wanted to do something computer related, so my mother did all the leg work into getting me into university. Further postponing the my ownership of adult responsibilities.

That being said, I knew university was the _real deal_.
Felt the weight of not getting any scholarships or being a model student, even more. This was the big leagues, not just the extended high-school program the 2 year college felt like. I entered university with my newly forming work ethic though, on the back of my parent's dime.

Needless to say, university was a brand new experience.
I was responsible for myself, I was alone for the first time, _and_ I could not mess up my grades. There is a saying: "Good Grades, Sleep, and a Social Life, pick two." Well, I chose the first two, not that I had a blooming social life to start off with. So my first two semesters, I did really well in all of my courses.

Since this was university, I did not have summer classes like I did back in college. It was my 3rd year of higher education, and I had the late realization of, "I should get an internship."
