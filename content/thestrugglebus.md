I am fairly confident that living the easy life, where everything is handed to you, is not a fulfilling life. The
hardships of efforts yield the most rewarding results. Existence sole purpose is not just to suffer, however one should
know suffering. I would feel like I would not know what I am fully capable of accomplishing, if I did not step out of my
comfort zone.

For that very reason, part of my current life goals is to intentionally seek out hardship, and see how I react. As a
result, I have learned that I am _not_ in fact invincible, though I would like to think so. I am a regular person just
like everybody else, and I too have my own struggles. You _can_ hurt me, I _do_ bleed, and I am _not_ perfect.

What separates me from the pack, is how I am able to handle it. Knowing that where I am weak allows me to compensate
with my strengths. The tricky part is finding out which of the weaknesses can be strengthened, and which ones need
special compensation. For the most part, most of the things that I am deficient in can be changed by practice and a
strong mental outlook. _However_, there are special problems that cannot be changed, no matter how hard you try. Finding
those are more difficult, because they act like the weaknesses you can change but take a tremendous amount of sunk
effort to reveal themselves. They require you to ride the struggle bus for a really long time, until you realize, you
need to be doing something different.
