Living the easy life, where everything is handed to you, feels like a sub-optimal experience. The hardships of efforts
yield the most rewarding results. Not saying that our purpose in this world is to suffer. However, one should know and
come to terms of being uncomfortable/suffering. If I never stepped outside the comfort-zone, I may have missed out on
the best moments of my life so far.

For that very reason, part of my current life goals is to intentionally seek out hardship. I want to see how I overcome
each obstacle I throw myself in front. As a result, I have learned that I am _not_ in fact invincible (though I would
like to think so). I am a regular person just like everybody else, and I too have my own struggles. You _can_ hurt me,
I _do_ bleed, I _do not_ want to work all the time, and I am _not_ perfect.

What separates me from the pack, is how I am able to handle myself. Knowing that where I am weak allows me to
compensate, with my strengths. The tricky part is finding out which of the weaknesses can be strengthened, and which
ones need special compensation. For the most part, most of the things that I am deficient in can be changed by practice
and a strong mental outlook. _However_, there are special problems that cannot be changed, no matter how hard you try.
Finding those are more difficult, because they act like the weaknesses you can change but take a tremendous amount of
sunk effort to reveal themselves. They require you to ride the struggle bus for a really long time, until you realize
something different needs to be done.
