Living the easy life, where everything is handed to you, feels like it would be unfulfilling. The hardships of efforts
yield the most satisfactory results. Not saying that our purpose in this world is to suffer. However, one should know
and come to terms of being uncomfortable/suffering. If I never stepped outside the comfort-zone, I may have missed out
on the best moments of my life so far.

For that very reason, part of my current life goals is to intentionally seek out hardship. I want to see how I overcome
each obstacle I throw myself in front of. As a result, I have learned that I am in fact _not_  invincible, though I
would like to think so. I am a regular person just like everybody else, and I too have my own struggles. You _can_ hurt
me, I _do_ bleed, I _do not_ want to work all the time, and I am _not_ perfect.

What I would like to think that separates me from the pack, is how I am able to handle myself. Knowing that where I am
weak allows me to compensate, with my strengths. The tricky part is finding out which of my weaknesses can be
strengthened, and which ones need special compensation. For the most part, most of the things that I am deficient in can
be changed by practice and a strong mental outlook. _However_, there are special problems that cannot be changed, no
matter how hard I try. Finding those are more difficult, because they act like the weaknesses I can change but take a
tremendous amount of sunk effort to reveal themselves. They require me to ride the struggle bus for a really long time,
until you realize something different needs to be done.
