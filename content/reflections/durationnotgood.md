It was a tough pill to swallow, but I eventually came to terms with _time not completely equaling merit_. That reason is
probably the main driving force that is pushing me to stop what I am currently doing. In favor of finding something else
better to do with my time.

The deciding factor was when I took a moment to examine my life as an outsider looking in. Having to watch stranger tote
around their consecutive days and _years_ of experience like it was the medal of honor, was a bit silly in my opinion. "
Look at me, and how many days I have spent consecutively working projects. Bet you did not know that I did that all in
my free time, did you? Spending every waking day of my life for almost the last 5 years, needing to make sure that I
check this little box that says I did something. I have got almost 8 years of experience, just so you know."

Those words feel hollow, like they have no substance backing them. What I have come to realize, it is not primarily
about what your past has been. It is about who you are today, the past is just a trail of pictures leading up to the
present version of you.

The biggest problem that I currently have, at the moment, is trying to answer this following question.
**So what?**

I have dedicated time the last consecutive 1,587 days to deliberate and purposeful practice. Six days a week were spent
with the intent of fully focusing on the task at hand. Meaning, I did not just show up and do the work. Each minute was
treated with respect, and I tried to get the most out of each working session. The other day of the week, is where I
disallowed myself from fully putting in the effort. Essentially keeping myself hungry for more, or digesting the entire
week. That way when the next day rolls in, I would be ready and back for more.

The fact that I have to spell this out, means that this is a poor way for me to show my merit. This is something that if
we were to meet in person, you would be able to the effects of all my decisions of the past. There I do not feel like I
need to explain the value that I had gotten from my journey, the results speak for themselves.

If I did not give any of that backstory, it would almost be the same wheelhouse as, "I have 29 years of experience
drinking liquids." However, I would also neglect to mention, that even with all my expertise, I still manage to breath
in fluids from time to time. I have not put as much deliberate effort into become drinking water that I have been
developing my career skills. Effort such as, expanding my attention span by rejecting social media, internet, and the
news. Training myself to not pick up my phone and check for updates every five
minutes. [Trying to get the most sleep, so I can come back the next day and knock it out of the park.](../thestrugglebus/a_greatestchallenge)
Also, a bunch of other things, but I think you get the point.

Yet, the best I can hope from any mention of duration as merit, would be skepticism. Sure, I might have done what I said
I have accomplished. However, you will not know that until you find yourself in my presence.

I have been searching for the meaning behind performing arduous tasks. At least with exercise the answer for that is
easy. The more I work out, the better I feel as time goes on. Since I have been on both sides of the spectrum, sedentary
and active, being active feels _leagues_ better. I still have not bought into getting large muscles yet. I have not seen
the point in achieving massive amounts of muscular hypertrophy. All that gets you is the ability to lift heavy things
and to get more attention from others. "Me make big weight go up and down. Me need attention from others to validate
many time spent running myself through meat grinder." I say that as though I do not flex in the mirror, or walk around
topless. "Me hypocrite, me try make excuse for why muscles not big as others."

# Sunk Cost

Let me start of by saying I have beef with how I have seen
the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost) being used. I have seen it been thrown up as an excuse
for just giving up on something that needed a bit more attention to fix. Therefore, I immediately labeled it as a handy
tool quitters use to justify giving up.

It is an easy card to play, just when things start to get tough, you have a convenient excuse to abandon hope. Sure,
when the project started, the excitement was there and the motivation tank was filled to the brim. Things where easy at
the start. However, as time passed, getting started and continuing to work became more difficult. At this point, the
ride on the struggle bus has been going for about a quarter of a mile. This feeling of _burnout_ begins to sink in. The
pivotal moment arrives, where the value of the original goal is weight against the cost of continuing. The road ahead
seems like it goes on forever. A glimmer of hope, an easy way out, the Sunk Cost Fallacy card. The time has already been
spent, and cannot be given back. It really was not about the destination, it was the things that where learned along the
way. Relief comes quickly, as the rationalization for giving up has been reached.

That is ðŸ’©, **motivation is ðŸ’©**, and for the most part the sunk cost fallacy is ðŸ’©. Motivation _is not_ what finishes
the job. Sure, it comes into play when the job starts, but it leaves a quarter of the way through and expects you to
take care of the rest. That is where discipline has to come in, clean up motivation's mess, and finish the task that was
started. I have never once leaned on something that boosts my motivation to finish something. I feel bad for people who
think they need more motivation to keep going. All they need to do is embrace _the suck_, tough it out for a while, and
things eventually get better.

Almost all the projects that I started, I have completed. They all go through the same phases:

- This is exciting and neat to work on.
- Wow, this is a lot of work.
- This sucks, I want to do something else.
- This still sucks, but it is getting better.
- Alright, the end is near.
- Back to being happy, because I am almost done.
- Complete project.
- Question current life choices
- Repeat.

It is the middle phases that require the most effort to get through, and where giving up is most appealing. The reason I
attribute my success, is because before I start, I make sure this is something I _really_ want to do. Does this bring
great meaning? The answer has to be really strong and convincing, because that is the answer to, "Why am I abusing
myself to get this done?" This is where essentialism plays a large role, because I start doing something to make
something I already enjoy, better. I am not chasing 10 things at once, and my mission statement is clear.

In fact, I specifically saved this post for a later time in the project, because I knew that motivation bastard would
leave me. Here I am, I have spent a solid 2 weeks of doing nothing but writing posts about my life, ignoring other
tasks. Currently, I want to ignore this entire project, and procrastinate
by  [adding more Anime Girls to my software tools](../accomplishments/c_theperfecttheme). However, I _will not_ allow
myself to do that. Accomplishing this task, of documenting my ultramarathon, will offer me something even better. The
freedom to move onto the next chapter in my life. I want to move on, but I will not let myself do that, I have invested
too much at this point to just give up and hope for the best. See were this sounds like to be an argument for sunk
costs? While, I cannot relax until I have put a nice little bow on my project, that does not mean there is not any value
in what I am doing currently. I am currently:

- Getting better at writing and communicating.
- Learning more about myself.
- Giving myself a sense of purpose.

I turn out better in the end, and all it cost me was the only thing I cannot get more of. There has only ever been one
project that I started to work on, and continued to do so even though it lost its meaning and sense of purpose. In the
end, I was just doing it to say, "I did it." I had no desire for the outcome, and ended up despising the whole thing in
the end.

Most of this is because of the attitude I had adopted and explained just moment ago. I am not saying that the attitude I
have is bad, it just that it is **really** important to figure out goal and the answer to **"So what?"** before
starting. I fell into this trap, because I lost my _so what_ answer, and I just continued, because that is what I was
doing before.
