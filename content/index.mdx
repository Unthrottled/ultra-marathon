# Preface

Although I did not really know it at the time, back in April 2017 I started the next big chapter of my life.
Personaly, I attribute most of the past 4 years and some change, of diligance, to my stubborness.

If you currently do not know what vague topic I am referring to, then here it is.
This thing right here is what I am talking about.

![Contributions Graph](./images/contributions.png)

Since starting as a _professional_ software developer back in 2015, I have never worked a job that contributes to open source.
What you see above, is how I dedicated spending part a large part of the 8 hours outside of work doing.

However, this only really paints a small part of the full picture of how my time was spent.
Here is a list of some true statements and rhetorical questions I think you can derive from my contribution graph:

- "He is dedicated to working on something."
- "Doesn't he know how to give up?"
- "He probably has nothing better to do."

There are probably a bunch more that I could come up with, but you get the gist.
The thing is that, I do want to _give up_, however I will not let myself do that.
What I am going to do instead, is warp the concept of giving up into: _starting a new chapter of my life_.
It is the same thing, just wrapped up in a pretty bow and easier for me to cope with.

Over the past 7 years of trying to figure out where my limits reside, I have accumulated some interesting stories.
I have learned things about myself and others.

I would be more than happy to give you the opportunity to satiate your curiosity.
Just moving on without saying anything, feels wrong.
Also the thought of not having any loose ends in my long quest, might allow me to move on.

I want to start the next chapter in my life, but first my friend, let my tell you where I have been so far.
The full picture deserves to be observed, and this is where you can view it.

# What to expect

As you might have already guessed, all of these post are going to be really personal.
You are going to get a good idea of my personality and who I am if you choose to continue.

My hope is that you can spend less time figuring this stuff out, if I say it first.
I have come to some of these conclusions myself.
However, most of this is borrowed wisdom from others.
It all blends together over time, so it hard to tell what is original and what is borrowed.

I do not think that you exactly need to do what I have done to gain experience.
I still think that you should at least try to find your ultimate self.
While avoiding getting yourself stuck in a whole you have dug a long time ago.

Also keep in mind, that most of these words are directed towards me.
Who knows, you might also get an interesting story out of this!

# How to Consume

I am essentially writing a memoir about the past 7 years of my life.
At the time of writing, I am not currently into sitting down and reading large blocks of text.
Therefore, I do not expect you to do the same.

I decided to break each of these posts down in such that they can be read independently of each other.
It is the combination of all these independent stories that paint the bigger picture of my journey.

Feel free to pick and choose what seems to be the most interesting.
I tried to make the titles seem to lead to something interesting and not misleading.
